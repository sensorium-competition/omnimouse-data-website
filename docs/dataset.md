On this page you can find summaries the neurophysiological datasets used to train and evaluate OmniMouse, including their sources, experimental modalities, and recording characteristics. For further information on individual experiment sessions, check out the [__Interactive Metadata query__](metadata_query.md).

**Ding et al., 2025a,b**  
- Data: Visual cortical population responses under controlled visual paradigms  

**Fahey et al., 2019**  
- Data: Two-photon imaging recordings from mouse visual cortex  

**Willeke et al., 2022 (Sensorium 2022)**  
- Data: Benchmark dataset for neural response prediction  

**Turishcheva et al., 2024 (Sensorium 2023)**

## Data Modalities

Across datasets, recordings include:

- Neuronal activity (two-photon calcium imaging; GCaMP6s)
- Visual stimuli (natural movies, images, drifting bars, parametric stimuli)
- Behavioral signals:
  - Running speed (treadmill encoder)
  - Eye movements
  - Pupil diameter
  - Face/eye video (~20 Hz)

All experiments were conducted in awake, head-fixed mice and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine.
